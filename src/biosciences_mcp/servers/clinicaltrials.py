"""ClinicalTrials.gov MCP Server - Clinical trial search and information.

This FastMCP server provides three tools for querying ClinicalTrials.gov API v2:

1. **search_trials** (Fuzzy): Natural language search returning ranked trial candidates
   - Searches by condition, intervention, location, phase, status
   - Returns TrialSearchCandidate with NCT CURIEs (~100-200 tokens/candidate)
   - Supports pagination with opaque cursors
   - Example: "breast cancer immunotherapy phase 3 recruiting"

2. **get_trial** (Strict): Lookup complete trial details by NCT CURIE
   - Requires resolved NCT CURIE from search_trials (Fuzzy-to-Fact protocol)
   - Returns full Trial with protocol, eligibility, outcomes, sponsors (~5K-10K tokens)
   - Validates NCT CURIE format (NCT:NNNNNNNN with 8 digits)
   - Example: NCT:00461032

3. **get_trial_locations** (Strict): Lookup facility locations and contacts
   - Requires resolved NCT CURIE from search_trials
   - Returns list of TrialLocation with facility names, addresses, contacts
   - Example: Multi-site trial with recruiting facilities across states

## Fuzzy-to-Fact Workflow

```python
# Phase 1: Fuzzy search
results = await search_trials("breast cancer immunotherapy", page_size=10)
top_trial = results["items"][0]  # {"id": "NCT:04123456", ...}

# Phase 2: Strict lookup (complete trial details)
trial = await get_trial(top_trial["id"])

# Phase 3: Get facility locations
locations = await get_trial_locations(top_trial["id"])
```

## Error Recovery

All tools provide actionable recovery hints via ErrorEnvelope:
- **UNRESOLVED_ENTITY**: Raw string passed to strict tool → Use search_trials first
- **INVALID_INPUT**: Malformed NCT CURIE → Correct format (NCT:NNNNNNNN with 8 digits)
- **ENTITY_NOT_FOUND**: Valid CURIE but no trial exists → Verify NCT ID
- **RATE_LIMITED**: API throttled → Retry after N seconds
- **UPSTREAM_ERROR**: API failure → Retry later

## Rate Limiting

Conservative 1 req/sec with exponential backoff on 429 responses (API allows ~50 req/min).

## Usage

```bash
# Run server
uv run fastmcp run src/biosciences_mcp/servers/clinicaltrials.py

# Dev mode with auto-reload
uv run fastmcp dev src/biosciences_mcp/servers/clinicaltrials.py
```

## Architecture

- **Client**: ClinicalTrialsClient (async httpx, no authentication required)
- **Models**: Trial, TrialSearchCandidate, TrialLocation, TrialProtocol, EligibilityCriteria, Outcome, Sponsor
- **Envelopes**: PaginationEnvelope, ErrorEnvelope (ADR-001 canonical formats)
- **API**: ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 (REST, JSON, no auth, cursor pagination)

    Searches ClinicalTrials.gov database using natural language queries with optional filters.

               Searches across conditions, interventions, titles, and descriptions.
               Minimum 2 characters required.
        status: Filter by recruitment status (RECRUITING, COMPLETED, NOT_YET_RECRUITING, etc.).
                Optional - omit to search all statuses.
        phase: Filter by trial phase (PHASE1, PHASE2, PHASE3, PHASE4, EARLY_PHASE1, NA).
               Optional - omit to search all phases.
        condition: Filter by condition/disease name (e.g., "diabetes", "lung cancer").
                   Optional - narrows results to specific conditions.
        intervention: Filter by intervention/treatment name (e.g., "bevacizumab", "surgery").
                      Optional - narrows results to specific treatments.
        location: Filter by geographic location (city, state, or country).
                  Examples: "Boston", "Massachusetts", "United States", "Japan".
                  Optional - narrows results to specific locations.
        slim: If true, return minimal fields for token efficiency (~100 tokens/trial).
              If false (default), return full candidate details (~200 tokens/trial).
        cursor: Opaque pagination cursor from previous response.
                Pass to retrieve next page of results.
        page_size: Number of results per page (1-200, default 50).
                   Larger pages use more tokens but fewer API calls.
